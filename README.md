#  Python Learning Journey (UWS Year 1)

This repository documents my full Python learning progression during Year 1 of my BSc Computing Science at the University of the West of Scotland (UWS).

Each week includes practice labs, exercises, and enhanced versions of programs covering:
- Input/output operations  
- Control flow (if/elif/else)  
- Loops (for, while, nested)  
- Lists, functions, and user input validation  
- File handling & data persistence with Pickle  
- Modular program design with menus and sub-systems
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

###  Key Projects
- **Mark-to-Grade System (v1–v8.0 and beyond...)** – student record manager with grading logic, statistics, validation, and averages.  
- **Shopping List App** – data stored via pickle with dynamic add/delete menu.  
- **Car Hire System** – local fleet management CLI app simulating a micro-database.  
- **Mathematical Tools** – range tables, trigonometric calculator, and palindrome validator.
- **Recipe & Nutrition Module** – simple CLI recipe manager generating healthy meal suggestions with ingredient tracking and calorie breakdown.
- **Holiday & Travel Program** – multi-layer loop project simulating travel itineraries, hotel combinations, and date scheduling across destinations.
   

###  Environment
- Python 3.11  
- IDEs: PyCharm, VS Code
